Alerting with Prometheus involves two main components: Prometheus Servers, 'which send alerts', 
and the Alertmanager, 'which manages those alerts'. 
The Alertmanager handles tasks like 'silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and sending 
notifications through various channels such as email, on-call systems, and chat platforms.'

The Key Steps To Set Up Alerting And Notifications Are:
------------------------------------------------------

.Set Up And Configure The Alertmanager.
.Configure Prometheus 'to communicate with the Alertmanager.'
.Create Alerting Rules In Prometheus.


Alertmanager:
-------------

The Alertmanager processes alerts sent by client applications like the Prometheus server, 
handling tasks such as 'deduplication, grouping, routing, silencing, and inhibition.' 
Alerts can be routed to various receivers, such as Email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie.

Key concepts:

.Grouping: Combines 'similar alerts into a single notification', which is helpful during 
large-scale outages to avoid overwhelming users with numerous alerts. Alerts can be grouped 
by factors like cluster and alert name, configured via a routing tree in the configuration file.

.Inhibition: 'Suppresses notifications for certain alerts' if related alerts are already firing, 
preventing redundant alerts from being sent.

.Silences: Temporarily 'mutes alerts based on defined matchers.' Silences can be configured 
through the Alertmanagers web interface.

.Client Behavior: Specific client behavior is required for advanced use cases where Prometheus 
isnt used for sending alerts.

.High Availability: 'Alertmanager supports clustering for high availability, and its 
recommended to point Prometheus to a list of all Alertmanagers rather than load balancing 
traffic between them.'


Alertmanager Configuration:
------------------------------

Alertmanager is configured via 'command-line flags' and a 'configuration file.'

.While The Command-Line Flags Configure 'immutable system parameters,'
To view all available command-line flags, run 'alertmanager -h.'


.The Configuration File defines 'inhibition rules, notification routing and notification 
receivers.'



Configuration File Introduction:

To Specify Which Configuration File To Load, Use The '--config.file flag.'

'   ./alertmanager --config.file=alertmanager.yml   '

Below Is How The File Is Organized:
